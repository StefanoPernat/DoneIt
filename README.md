# Done It

## Description

**Done It** is a little web app useful for tracking my done list tasks,
I will build this web application using **VueJS** framework for the frontend,
I will also use Golang for building the backend part.  

## Why

I'd like to know if it is possible to build something using the language I love
and this awesome frontend framework I want to learn.

## Mandatory

### Backend

- Use Golang modules
- Build rest api using [HttpRouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)

### Frontend
